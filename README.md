# FakeNews-Detection

This project is a Fake News Detection System developed using Python, pandas, and scikit-learn. The system aims to classify news articles as genuine or fake with high accuracy by leveraging advanced text processing techniques and multiple machine learning algorithms.

## Project Overview

With the rise of fake news, this project addresses the challenge by creating a reliable detection mechanism through data preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning.

## Key Features

### Data Preprocessing:

Combined datasets of genuine and fake news.
Applied text cleaning to normalize content (lowercasing, removing URLs, HTML tags, punctuation, digits, and newlines).

### Feature Extraction:

Used TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numerical features.
Machine Learning Models:

Implemented Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting classifiers.
Achieved up to 99.6% accuracy.

### Evaluation:

Split data into training and testing sets.
Generated classification reports for performance assessment.

### Technologies Used
